# wolfProvider version 1.0.0 (July 17, 2024)

This is the first release of wolfProvider. It is similar to wolfEngine (which
creates a library to interface with OpenSSL 1.x). WolfProvider interfaces with
OpenSSL 3.x using our wolfCrypt cryptography module.

This first release has sample applications for Android as well as XCode (iOS).
In addition, there are utility scripts added as a convenience for compiling
all the dependencies of wolfProvider.
